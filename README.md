# Cloud File Storage & Sharing System (AWS S3)

This project demonstrates how to build a **Cloud File Storage & Sharing System** using **Amazon S3**. The system allows users to upload, manage, and share files securely in the cloud, leveraging AWS S3’s scalable, durable, and low-cost storage capabilities.

## Project Overview

The Cloud File Storage & Sharing System allows users to:

- **Upload files**: Store various types of files such as documents, images, and videos.
- **Share files**: Generate public or private links to share files with others.
- **Manage files**: List, download, and delete files securely using AWS S3 buckets.

The goal of this project is to create a simple, secure, and efficient way to manage files in the cloud using AWS services, with a focus on scalability, durability, and ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- **Storage**: AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service) for file storage
- **Backend**: Node.js (or Python) to handle file upload, retrieval, and sharing logic
- **Security**: AWS IAM for access control and AWS S3 bucket policies
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito for user authentication (optional)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vanilla JS) for user interaction
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: AWS CloudFormation or Terraform for provisioning AWS resources
- **Deployment**: AWS Lambda (optional for serverless) or EC2 (if a traditional server is needed)

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload files to S3 buckets using pre-signed URLs or AWS SDK.
- **File Listing**: Display a list of uploaded files along with metadata.
- **File Sharing**: Generate temporary or permanent links for sharing files with others.
- **Access Control**: Restrict file access with IAM policies and S3 bucket permissions.
- **Scalability**: Use AWS S3’s auto-scaling capabilities to handle large numbers of file uploads and downloads.
- **Security**: Optionally integrate AWS Cognito to secure file access and control user permissions.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- An **AWS account** with permissions to create S3 buckets and manage IAM roles.
- **AWS CLI** installed and configured on your machine.
- **Node.js** (or Python) installed to run the backend.
- Basic understanding of **AWS S3**, **IAM**, and **file storage**.
